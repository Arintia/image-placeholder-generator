## Image Placeholder Generator by YiÄŸit Atak

### About the project
This project is a web application that allows you to generate a custom placeholder PNG. It utilizes the powerful HTML Canvas5 feature and converts the canvas to a PNG file. It features a dark and light theme and you can easily switch between themes to suit your needs. You can specify a width, height, font, font size, font weight, text, text color, background color and the app converts it all into a canvas which is then converted to a PNG file and served to the end-user as a downloadable file. This project will likely be developed further as time goes on. Suggestions for improvement are welcome, feel free to also fork the project and work on improvements yourself if you wish. Check the to-do list down below for my current road map for this project.
